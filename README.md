I built this WhatsApp bot using a package using a package called bailey https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys.

It basically sends automated messages using WhatsApp. You can use it however you want, but adhere to WhatsApp's terms and conditions.

## Installation

To install, just run

```npm install```

### Running

Run it using:

```node app.js```

### You can also use nodemon

Alternatively, you can also use nodemon to run it. Simply install it using the command below:

```npm install nodemon```

Add this to package.json file

```
    "scripts" : {
      "start": "nodemon app.js"
    }
```
After doing that, you can start it by running:

```npm start```
